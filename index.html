		<div class="about-left">
  			<p>I’m a GIS Analyst by trade and work experieince. Presently taking this Front End Web Development class to gain a handle on web design and JavaScript. It is anticipated that I may gain a significant grasp of the technology, that would allow me to begin developing Spatial Web Applications and leveraging the ESRI JavaScript API. Hopefully I'll be able to convert all of our Flex Web Apps to JavaScript Aps.</p>
  			<p>As this page makes fairly clear, I'm having my difficulties grasping CSS. I'm hoping that I will someday get some of this figured out.</p>

  			<p>I grew up in a small farm town in Eastern Idaho, St Anthony. Following my ninth grade year, we moved briefly to Orange County California. This lasted only 8 months, eventually retreating back to Eastern Idaho to the town of Idaho Falls. I attended college in North Idaho, University of Idaho in Moscow. I’ve spent many summers in Sun Valley Idaho and 20 years in Seattle before moving back to Idaho. I now reside in Boise on the western side of Idaho.</p>
